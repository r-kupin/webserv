1. The server starts by reading the nginx configuration file, which specifies 
the port number, server root directory, and any other settings.

2. The server creates a listener socket and binds it to the port number 
specified in the configuration file.

3. The server enters an infinite loop, waiting for incoming connections using 
poll().

4. When a client connects to the server, the server accepts the connection and 
creates a new thread or worker process to handle the request.

5. The server reads the incoming request from the client and parses it to 
determine the requested resource and any additional information, such as headers or query parameters.

6. If the request includes a cookie, the server extracts the session ID from 
the cookie and checks if it corresponds to an existing session. If a session exists, the server retrieves the session data from a storage medium such as a file or database. Otherwise, the server generates a new session ID and creates a new session.

7. The server checks if the requested resource is a static file or a dynamic 
content generator, such as a CGI script or a PHP script.

8. If the requested resource is a static file, the server reads the file from 
disk and sends it back to the client in the response. If a session ID cookie is present, the server adds the session ID to the cookie and sets an expiry date.

9. If the requested resource is a dynamic content generator, the server 
invokes the appropriate handler module, such as mod_cgi or mod_php, to generate the content. If a session ID cookie is present, the server passes the session data to the handler as an environment variable or input parameter.

10. After generating the response, the server adds a Set-Cookie header to the 
response containing the session ID and expiry date, if a session was created or updated.

11. The server sends the response back to the client and closes the connection. 
The thread or worker process is terminated or returned to the pool.

12. The server periodically saves the session data to a storage medium to 
ensure that sessions persist across server restarts.

13. The server can be configured to use SSL/TLS encryption for secure 
    connections.

14. The server can be configured to use virtual hosting to serve multiple 
domains from the same server.

15. The server can be configured to use URL rewriting to map requests to 
different resources or to implement clean URLs.

16. The server can be configured to use caching to improve performance and 
reduce server load.

17. The server can implement advanced security features such as rate limiting, 
IP blocking, and request filtering.

18. The server can log requests and responses for debugging and analysis 
    purposes.

19. To parse the nginx configuration file, the server reads and parses the 
configuration file manually, following the syntax and semantics of the nginx configuration file format.

20. The server extracts the relevant settings from the configuration file and 
uses them to configure the server's behavior, such as the server's root directory, port number, and other settings.
